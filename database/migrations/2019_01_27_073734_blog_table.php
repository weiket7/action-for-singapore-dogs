These dogs are now unable to breed but can still continue to defend their boundaries and resources, while finally reducing in numbers due to natural attrition.</p><p>A veterinary facility was built so that sterilization procedures could be more efficiently and effectively carried out on the island. It is estimated that there may be at least 300 strays on the Island. We knew we had a mammoth task ahead of us as this initiative could take up to 2 years to complete.</p><p>In January 2015, while mapping the dog population in tandem, we started trapping and sterilization operations, which involved our talented team of trappers who are experienced in handling the strays humanely, our team of experienced vets who have selflessly volunteered their time and expertise to perform the sterilization procedures onsite; and our facility officer who maintains the facility and ensures the dogs receive proper pre-op and post-op care.</p><p>To date, we are happy to announce that a total of 31 sterilization procedures have been safely carried out on the Island, all solely managed by ASD. Buoyed by this progress, we endeavour to sterilize 100 dogs in the next 3 months and we believe once this initial target is reached, the population should start to stabilize, as we move ahead of the reproduction cycle.</p><p>Since we were established in 2000, ASD has been a strong advocate of sterilization as a long-term strategy to curb the stray population. This has proven a far more effective measure than culling which has shown no meaningful results over decades.</p><p>This pilot project is an extremely important milestone for ASD as we can now demonstrate, with numbers being closely monitored by authorities, that the stray population can be safely managed with sterilization and eventually reduced. This will, in turn, reduce the number of incidents associated with strays and help us avoid the senseless culling.</p><p>As can be expected, such projects require a huge amount of resources, mainly funds and manpower. Since we started in Dec 2014 we have spent over $10,000 on trapping, sterilizing and equipping the sterilization facility with stainless steel enclosures for recuperation and other critical items.</p><p>The project cost for each AWG is estimated at $200,000 and we humbly ask for your help to raise this. Here is how you can help:</p><p>We have setup the JUBILANT Sponsorship Fund, where you can have a personal stake in this project by sponsoring each of these dogs as we sterilize them and give them a lease of life, for they will be spared being culled. That is our light at the end of the tunnel, where we can emerge JUBILANT, knowing we have helped save their lives!</p><p>1) It cost an average of $250 to trap and another $200 to sterilize each dog and you can be their sponsor by donating to this fund. A webpage will be set up where you will be able to monitor the number of sterilizations done and how your donations are helping.</p><p>2) We also need part time and full time volunteers who can work on the project on a salary basis. Please email us at info@asdsingapore.com with the heading “TNR Project” if you are interested in joining us.</p><p>We are fully committed to making this project a success and to pave the way for future TNR strategies in Singapore. We want you to be a part of this!</p><p>Donations can be made through cheque or funds transfer.

There, the landscape is harsh and stark, occupied by large towering structures that belch fumes all day. There is scant shelter from the scorching sun of the day, hardly any warmth from the bitter cold of night, and there are few&nbsp;food sources.</p><p>On this island, 300 dogs have been trying to eke out an existence of constant hunger, disease, abuse and persecution. This is also the place where we have initiated Project Jubilation, a Trap-Neuter-Release (TNR) program, since the beginning of the year.

One shudders at the thought of how much more suffering these dogs will have to endure!</p><p>But if we look past the numbers and look at the real, tangible benefits, we are looking at lives that will not be needlessly nor senselessly culled, and as the population stabilizes, a structured feeding program can be put in place to maintain the sterilized strays till they pass on of natural causes.</p><p>And if we can look at each of these individual dogs not as a statistic but as a precious life, you will see each of them have their tale to tell, just like Tui.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://localhost/asd/public/assets/images/blog/news-flash/tnr-tui.jpg\"><figcaption>Tui gave birth to 10 puppies the day after she was trapped</figcaption></figure><p>Tui was just one of the anonymous black dogs roaming the island in search of sustenance and if only she could talk, she would probably tell you of her hardships on this barren island.

While the ARC is a comfortable and conducive place, nothing beats a home and to this end, we continue to strive to have as many dogs adopted from the ARC as possible!&nbsp;<br><br>Another highlight of the year is Project Jubilation, our Trap-Neuter-Release project on Jurong Island. After 1 year of work trapping, sterilising and releasing the many strays on the island, we have sterilised 150 dogs and expended $100,000 so far. The project is far from over as there remains another 150 more dogs that needs to be sterilised and we are desperately trying to get ahead of the reproduction cycle. Many challenges lie ahead, from managing the stray population so that the dogs do not pose a nuisance nor danger, to having enough monetary resources to see the project through.&nbsp;<br><br>All in all, it has been a very challenging but fruitful year, and we forsee the year ahead to be fraught with more challenges, pitfalls and hurdles, and we definitely cannot progress without the support of all of you, many of whom have helped with generous donations, time and effort in the many aspects of our work.

Barely out of her puppyhood, Carmel was friendly, curious and loved to play. But each time Carmel tried to play ‘Catch’ or ‘Bite The Shoe’, she was declared a nuisance and once again, bundled to another home. Within a few short weeks of her rescue, Carmel had already acquired the dubious title of ‘Problem Dog’.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, with such a reputation preceding her, not a single person could be found who was willing to open his home and heart to Carmel. Ultimately, she was placed under the care of a kind-hearted security guard at a factory, while humans she had never known debated her fate.&nbsp;<br>Housed at Nanas now, Carmel understands all the rules. Don’t bite the goats, play nice with all her doggy friends and don’t chase the&nbsp;<br><br>horse. She’s a good girl deserving of a loving home. But until we can find her family, please help us keep Carmel safe.&nbsp;<br><br>Carmel is living at NANAS which is situated in JB Malaysia, so this makes it very difficult to arrange viewings. Please find it in your heart to sponsor Carmel, so that if she does not find her “forever” home she can at least spend her remaining days where she has found some happiness. Should you decide to sponsor Carmel you will be given regular updates as to how she is doing.</p>');
